- Decided the theme of the project: Compilers
- Looking to contribute to open source projects like Babel, Prettier, ESLint etc
- CTA:
  - Getting familiar with syntax of JS and building few projects
  - Learning about the projects and how they work
- Learning curve over the next few months:
  -  Spend time learning about ASTs, javascript and how the project works
  - After going through codebase, we will start contributing and solving simple issues. (This would go in the documentation of our project)
  - Later once we have a good idea about how the project works, we can continue to take up bigger features
