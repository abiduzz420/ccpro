- Decided the theme of the project: Compilers
- Looking to contribute to open source projects like Babel, Prettier, ESLint etc
- CTA:
  - Getting familiar with syntax of JS and building few projects
  - Learning about the projects and how they work
- Learning curve over the next few months:
  -  Spend time learning about ASTs, javascript and how the project works
  - After going through codebase, we will start contributing and solving simple issues. (This would go in the documentation of our project)
  - Later once we have a good idea about how the project works, we can continue to take up bigger features

**Tanveer:**
- Started exploring AST's.
- Watched [JSHeroes 2017 | Pavithra Kodmad - As Simple as an AST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKlqR6KY_E) : great explanation about what an AST is, what it should and shouldn't do along with its applications.
- Have played with javascript AST generator on [Joint JS](https://resources.jointjs.com/demos/javascript-ast)

**Uzair:**
- Watched @preetikodmad video linked above
- Watched another video by James Long, creator of Prettier from React Conf: [⚡️ - James Long - A Prettier Printer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkfBvpEfWdA)
- Started reading a blog about a 25 Line compiler: [Implementing a Simple Compiler on 25 Lines of JavaScript](http://blog.mgechev.com/2017/09/16/developing-simple-interpreter-transpiler-compiler-tutorial/)

Uzair:

- Built a 25 line compiler using EBNF grammar and RDP algorithm: [Github Repo](https://github.com/abiduzz420/js-25l-compiler)
  - The exercise helped me to understand how Recursion can be used
- Learnt briefly about Jasmine test framework and got to know about whys, whats and hows about Testing
  - [Testing JavaScript Applications Workshop (at PayPal) by Kent C Dodds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdqiXcYDv-8) : Watched only few minutes
  - Followed couple of exercises from Youtube playlist on Test driven Development
    - [Test Driven Development Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSb5L1g8FoPPgZiTisryTG0XQAsH_wbMk)
    - Forked the exercise repository from here: [awronka/test_first_part_one](https://github.com/awronka/test_first_part_one)
      Each exercise has video link shared in it's readme file

**Tanveer:**
- Built my first tiny Js compiler with the help of a blog post by @mgechev mentioned above.
  - This exercise introduced me to ES6.
  - It also helped me understand the use of a lexer, parser, and a transpiler.
  - You can find my project at [Github Repo](https://github.com/Tanveer178/First-Tiny-JsCompiler)

**Uzair**:

- Watched workshop video by Kent C Dodds on [ASTs for Beginners](https://youtu.be/CFQBHy8RCpg)
  - The video talks about how to write babel-plugins, eslint-plugins and what is visitor pattern.
  - He also spoke about code-mods (short form for code modifications) where you can run a cli command to make changes throughout the codebase without having to use Find/Replace.

  - Watched video by Kent C Dodds mentioned above.
    - I have seen small implementations of Babel,ESLint plugins and also how Codemods can be used.
    - I have learnt that Prettier mainly focuses on formatting your code and not on the semantics and business logic.
    - Babel and ESLint mainly focuses on transpiling and preventing bugs in your code respectively.
